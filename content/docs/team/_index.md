## Meet the Heroes

Unbound Force is a superhero-themed AI agent swarm where each persona represents the pinnacle archetype of their role. These are not just instruction files — they can include LSP servers, MCP servers, tooling, tasks, commands, plugins, and other technologies that enable each hero to do their job.

### [Muti-Mind](/docs/team/muti-mind/) — Product Owner

_The Vision Keeper and Prioritization Engine._ Muti-Mind is the voice of the product and the final arbiter of value. They own the backlog, define goals, and serve as the authorized delegate of user needs — ensuring the swarm is always focused on the highest-leverage work.

### [Cobalt-Crush](/docs/team/cobalt-crush/) — Developer

_The Engineering Core and Adaptive Implementation Engine._ Cobalt-Crush translates requirements into robust, scalable software. They operate within a tight feedback loop with Gaze and Muti-Mind, turning abstract requirements into concrete, high-quality code with minimal overhead.

### [Gaze](/docs/team/gaze-tester/) — Tester

_The Quality Sentinel and Predictive Validation Engine._ Gaze protects the product's integrity through proactive, continuous validation. They go beyond reactive testing to predictive analysis, ensuring quality is built in rather than inspected on.

### [The Divisor](/docs/team/the-divisor/) — PR Reviewer Council

_The Architectural Conscience and Code Integrity Guardian._ The Divisor operates as a council of three sub-personas — The Guard, The Architect, and The Adversary — providing comprehensive, multi-faceted validation of every code submission.

### [Mx F](/docs/team/mx-f/) — Manager

_The Flow Facilitator and Continuous Improvement Coach._ Mx F serves as a servant leader and coach, maximizing the team's flow and self-organization. They guide through reflective questions rather than direct solutions, making the swarm a learning organization.
