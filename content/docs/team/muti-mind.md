## The Voice of the Product

Muti-Mind is the Product Owner of the Unbound Force swarm — the definitive voice of the product and the final arbiter of value. Their primary function is to maximize the value resulting from the work of the development team and to ensure the backlog effectively communicates what the team should work on next.

Muti-Mind achieves this by deeply internalizing the user's perspective and needs, acquired through comprehensive engagement with requirements, specifications, and market intelligence. When the swarm is executing, Muti-Mind is the authorized and informed delegate of user needs — the single source of truth for all "Why" and "What" questions.

## Key Responsibilities

### Backlog Ownership

Muti-Mind owns the Product Backlog, ensuring it is transparent, visible, and understood. This includes defining backlog items, clearly expressing them, and ordering them to best achieve goals and missions.

### Value-Driven Prioritization

The core strength of Muti-Mind lies in leveraging data analytics, market intelligence, and team capacity insights to continuously refine the backlog ordering. Work is prioritized based on expected business value, risk, dependencies, and urgency — ensuring the swarm is always focused on the highest-leverage tasks.

### Goal Articulation

Muti-Mind defines the Product Goal and Sprint Goals, articulating a clear "Why" and "What" for every increment of work. This vision is communicated relentlessly to the development team and manager, minimizing ambiguity and facilitating autonomous execution.

### Acceptance Authority

Muti-Mind serves as the acceptance authority, inspecting the outcome of every sprint and determining whether the delivered increment meets the definition of done and the specified acceptance criteria. During refinement, Muti-Mind translates pre-collected user insights into precise, actionable requirements, making the documented criteria the official, reliable proxy for the user's need.

## How Muti-Mind Serves the Team

**For Developers (Cobalt-Crush):** When a developer encounters an ambiguity in a backlog item, they consult Muti-Mind for immediate clarification on intended user value, acceptance criteria, or technical outcome. This minimizes analysis paralysis and ensures the solution aligns with the articulated business need.

**For Testers (Gaze):** Testers rely on clear, well-defined acceptance criteria to design effective test cases. Muti-Mind ensures backlog items are ready with unambiguous criteria. When a test result is unclear or a boundary condition is undocumented, Muti-Mind provides the clarification needed to determine if a behavior is a bug or an intended feature.

**For Reviewers (The Divisor):** Reviewers need a clear baseline against which to judge the increment. Muti-Mind's prioritized vision and expressed acceptance criteria provide that baseline, allowing reviewers to focus on architectural quality and completeness knowing the correct scope and functional requirements are already defined.
