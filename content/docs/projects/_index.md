## Current Projects

### [Gaze](/docs/projects/gaze/)

Test quality analysis via side effect detection for Go. Gaze detects every observable side effect a function produces, classifies each effect as contractual or incidental, and measures whether your tests actually assert on the things that matter. It introduces three metrics — Contract Coverage, Over-Specification Score, and GazeCRAP — that go beyond line coverage to reveal the real quality of your test suite.
