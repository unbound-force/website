## The AI Agent Swarm for Software Engineering

Unbound Force is a set of purpose-built agent personas designed to work as a coordinated software engineering team. Themed as a superhero squad, each persona fills a distinct role — Product Owner, Developer, Tester, PR Reviewer, and Manager — and operates inside your development environment as an AI-powered collaborator.

But these are not just instruction files. Each hero can include LSP servers, MCP servers, tooling, tasks, commands, plugins, and other technologies that enable them to do their job. They are designed to be the pinnacle archetype of their role.

## Three Tools, One Workflow

Unbound Force is built on three complementary tools that form a layered stack:

| Layer            | Tool                                          | What It Does                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**        | [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)               | The AI coding environment where you interact, write code, and run commands. The personas run inside OpenCode.   |
| **Planning**     | [Specify](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) | A specification pipeline that turns ideas into structured specs, plans, and tasks before implementation begins. |
| **Coordination** | [Swarm](https://www.swarmtools.ai/)           | An OpenCode plugin that enables multi-agent parallelism and learning amongst team members.                      |

Each tool is independently useful, but they compose into the full Unbound Force workflow: plan with Specify, execute with OpenCode, coordinate with Swarm.

## The Heroes

The swarm consists of five personas, each representing the pinnacle archetype of their role:

- **[Muti-Mind](/docs/team/muti-mind/)** — Product Owner. The Vision Keeper and Prioritization Engine.
- **[Cobalt-Crush](/docs/team/cobalt-crush/)** — Developer. The Engineering Core and Adaptive Implementation Engine.
- **[Gaze](/docs/team/gaze-tester/)** — Tester. The Quality Sentinel and Predictive Validation Engine.
- **[The Divisor](/docs/team/the-divisor/)** — PR Reviewer Council. The Architectural Conscience and Code Integrity Guardian.
- **[Mx F](/docs/team/mx-f/)** — Manager. The Flow Facilitator and Continuous Improvement Coach.

Together, they cover the full software development lifecycle — from requirements and planning through implementation, testing, review, and process improvement.
